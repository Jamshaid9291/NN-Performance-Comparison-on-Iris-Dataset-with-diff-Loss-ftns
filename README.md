# NN-Performance-Comparison-on-Iris-Dataset-with-diff-Loss-ftns
his project explores the impact of different loss functions (categorical_crossentropy, mean_squared_error, binary_crossentropy) and optimizers (adam, sgd, rmsprop) on the training performance of a feedforward neural network using TensorFlow/Keras. The model is trained on a personalized 80% subset of the Iris dataset.
